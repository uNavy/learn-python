# 🐍 Python Comments and Execution Guide 🚀  

## 📌 Introduction  
This guide explains different types of **comments** in Python and how to **execute scripts** using Jupyter Notebook 💓 and the terminal 🖥️.  

---  

## ✏️ Comments in Python  

### 📝 Single-Line Comments  
Single-line comments start with `#` and are **ignored** by the Python interpreter.  

```python
# 🚫 THIS IS A COMMENT
print("Hello,")  # 👋 Printing a greeting
print("Good morning!")  # 🌞 Another comment
```

### 📝 Multi-Line Comments  
Multi-line comments are written using **triple** single (`'''`) or double (`"""`) quotes.  

```python
'''
📌 THIS IS A MULTI-LINE COMMENT  
❌ print("THIS STATEMENT WON'T BE EXECUTED")
'''
```

They can also be written in a single line:  

```python
'''' 📝 THIS IS A MULTI-LINE COMMENT IN A SINGLE LINE '''  
```

## ⚡ Running the Script  

### ⚙️ Using Jupyter Notebook Cells  
In **Jupyter Notebook**, code can be divided into **executable cells** using `#%%`.  

```python
#%%
print("Hello World 🌍")
#%%
```

### 🖥️ Using the Terminal  
Run the script in a terminal with the following command:  

```sh
python main.py  # ▶️ Run Python script
```

---  

## ✨ Summary 
✅ Use `#` for **single-line comments**.  
✅ Use `'''` or `"""` for **multi-line comments**.  
✅ In Jupyter Notebook, `#%%` is used to **define executable cells**.   
✅ Run Python scripts using the **terminal** with `python filename.py`.  

🎉 **Happy Coding!** 🚀🐍💡
